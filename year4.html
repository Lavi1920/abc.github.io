 This 
Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts. Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to find out about the mysterious event to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other rival schools 
Thomas and Mary Riddle, with their grown-up son Tom Riddle Senior, have been considered the most unpopular people occupying the Riddle House, located on a hill overlooking the Yorkshire County village of Little Hangleton, many decades ago. Thomas was a snobbish squire who had the worst attitude that nobody wanted in a village leader, while Mary did retailing for Lady Margaret Nurseries branch of the British Association of Garden Centres. Referred to as "white trash" by most of the village, the Riddle family have looked down on the most poverty-stricken families in the village for generations and sneered at anything disturbing for their peace, for they didn't hold such nonsense in their daily lives. The story begins in August of 1943, where an absurd tragedy happened inside the house that nobody is able to find out how it happened. When the Riddles' maid goes to work that day, she discovers all three Riddles dead in the drawing room, "still in their dinner things". The police find no evidence of any kind of murder or suicide, claiming to be in perfect health condition except for the fact that they were dead. They arrest the Riddles' gardener Frank Bryce for questioning, since the door and windows was never forced open or shattered on the night of their murder, and the Riddles' cook testified that he was the only one with a key to the house. Frank, however, said the only person he saw that night was a mysterious dark-haired boy, and was released due to lack of evidence, but many still believed he committed the murders. This dark-haired boy known as Tom Riddle did in fact do it, but was able to fool the police. The victims being his family members.

Half a century later on the night of 16 August, 1994, an elderly Frank is still working as the groundskeeper at the Riddle house. He sees a fire flickering in one of the rooms and goes over to investigate, thinking it is a couple boys who regularly disturb him. Inside, he overhears the same boy he saw on the night of the Riddles' murder, now grown up as Lord Voldemort (who, still unknown to him, was Tom Snr's unwanted son), and his servant Peter Pettigrew planning to capture Harry Potter with the aid of a reliable servant. Voldemort, Frank learns, also plans to reward Pettigrew for his help in capturing Bertha Jorkins, a Ministry of Magic employee who Voldemort extracted information from before killing. Frank is then discovered by Voldemort's snake Nagini, who reports his presence to her master via Parseltongue. When Pettigrew beckons him in as a guest, Frank stands up to Voldemort, who is unpleased that Muggles like the elderly gardener would be spying on him. Frank doesn't know what a Muggle is, and despite being offended that Voldemort called him one when it is explained that term means he's not a wizard, he is still determined to inform the police about the intruders' plot but horrified upon seeing Voldemort's weak form. Voldemort then casts the Avada Kedavra curse, ending Frank's life before the book can describe what Voldemort looks like. Simultaneously, about 200 miles away in the Surrey County town of Little Whinging, Harry wakes up from a nightmare at the Dursleys' house on Privet Drive.
